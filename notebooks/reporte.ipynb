    "## Motivation\n",
    "I lived in Galicia for a little over two years, and I was always told that it rained a lot in this area, and even more in the past, that \"the cold in Galicia is different, it gets into your bones.\"  \n",
    "This always sparked my curiosity, asking myself: How many days does it rain a year? How cold is it? Is this \"chill in your bones\" due to humidity? Which city is the coldest of all? And many other questions I didn't know how to answer.  \n",
    "So I decided to do this project. Its purpose is to answer several of these questions that sparked my curiosity.  "

To answer some of the aforementioned questions, I will conduct other types of studies, comparisons, and predictions."
