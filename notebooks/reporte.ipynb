    "## Motivation\n",
    "I lived in Galicia for a little over two years, and I was always told that it rained a lot in this area, and even more in the past, that \"the cold in Galicia is different, it gets into your bones.\"  \n",
    "This always sparked my curiosity, asking myself: How many days does it rain a year? How cold is it? Is this \"chill in your bones\" due to humidity? Which city is the coldest of all? And many other questions I didn't know how to answer.  \n",
    "So I decided to do this project. Its purpose is to answer several of these questions that sparked my curiosity.  "

    "## ASK \n",
    "This project contains data from the largest cities in Galicia (Coruña, Lugo, Ourense, Vigo, Pontevedra, and Santiago de Compostela), where I will conduct data analysis from January 1, 2023, to March 1, 2025. To answer some of the aforementioned questions, I will conduct other types of studies, comparisons, and predictions."

You can obtain data for up to 10 years, but only for one point at a time. Forecast data, on the other hand, is obtained from the MeteoSIX API in JSON (see the streamlit).  \n",
    "### They are organized  \n",
    "We have 6 tables (one for each city) with a total of 4 columns (date, humidity, precipitation, and temperature) and 821 rows (one row is equivalent to one day). This represents a total of almost 5,000 data points.\n",
    "Meanwhile, for the forecast, there are 6 time tables (one for each city) and 5 columns (here, sky_state is added to the columns). This represents a total of 144 data points, considering all the tables.\n"
